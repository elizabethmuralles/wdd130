        <p>Hi! I'm Elizabeth Muralles, a 22 year old from beutiful Guatemala. I'm currently studying
            Software Development at BYU, where I'm learning to code, solve problems, and build creative tech solutions.
            I'm passionate about how techonology can make life easier and more connected. When I'm not studying or working on projects,
            I love spending time with my family, reading books, and watching movies or series. I'm excited to keep growing in this field and to 
            use what I learn to make a positive difference through technology.
